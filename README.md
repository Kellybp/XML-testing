# XML-testing
Testing out using XML 

## Why
Trying to familiarize myself with .dtd and XML interfacing. 
Initially started as an academic assignment.

## What I learned
Honestly, I have discovered a new appreciation for XML. 
Using document type definitions has been fun, not something I expect to use as much, but I have a better grasp as to all our modern components work together.
